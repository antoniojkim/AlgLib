# Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given a sequence of non-negative integers a_1,...,a_n, design an algorithm that computes the length of the longest subsequence of increasing numbers within the original sequence. For example, on instance

0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15

one of the longest increasing subsequences is 0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15 so the valid solution for this instance
is 6. (Note that there are multiple increasing subsequences of length 6 for this example.)
